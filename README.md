# Archspec (Rust bindings)

Archspec provides standardized human-readable labels for aspects and capabilities of a system with functions to query and compare them.

The original bindings in Python can be found at https://github.com/archspec/archspec and exposes a similar API but with some constructs adapted to a more ergonomic Rust style.
